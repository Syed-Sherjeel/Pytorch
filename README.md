# DeepLearning for image processing
Purpose of this project is to develop and design state of art image classifier for fashion classification and a classical method of recognizing hand written digits
# Getting Stated
In order to be able to run this project we will be needing following packages. 
- numpy
- sklearn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Pytorch
# Installing dependencies
```
pip install sklearn 
pip install numpy 
pip install pandas 
pip install matplotlib 
pip install pytroch
```
# Usage Example
```
Usage is explained well in notebook.
```
This will output a classification variable 0 or 1.whereas,1 stands for survived and 0 stands for not survived.
